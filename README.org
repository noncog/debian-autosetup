#+TITLE:debian-autosetup

A simple bash script (compatible with Debian-based distributions) to install software and configure your dotfiles after a fresh install.

This script is capable of installing:
- Debian sources
- Apt packages
- Flatpak/Flathub packages
- Fonts
- Git Repositories
- GTK themes
- Dotfiles managed with git --bare repositories

* Usage
#+BEGIN_SRC :tangle no
  git clone https://github.com/not-tacit/debian-autosetup
  cd debian-autosetup
  chmod +x install.sh
  ./install.sh
#+END_SRC

* Customizatoin
By default, the script is setup to my configuration but is modular and easily customizable.

- Just modify the lists with your requirements and they will be installed.
- Some actions like additional processing of git repositories after download may require custom scripting.
